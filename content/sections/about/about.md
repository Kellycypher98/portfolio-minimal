I'm Kelvin Boateng, or you can call me Kelly Cypher. I love working with technology and making cool things happen. I've been doing it for over a year and a half, and I'm all about turning ideas into real stuff.

I'm not just into tech talk—I really enjoy using my skills to get things done. Whether it's writing code, solving problems, or starting new projects, I'm all in. I like taking on challenges and turning big ideas into something you can see and use.

Let's make your tech ideas come to life together. I'm excited to share what I know and ready to take on new projects with you.
